**Internal Assessment Resource**

**Achievement Standard:** 	91901

**Standard title:** 	Apply** user experience methodologies to develop a design for a digital technologies outcome

**Credits:** 	3 

**Resource title:** 	It’s not U, it’s UX!

**Resource reference:** 	Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko** 3.2A 

**Teacher/Kaiako guidelines**

The following guidelines are supplied to enable teachers/kaiako to carry out valid and consistent assessment using this internal assessment resource.

Teachers/kaiako need to be very familiar with the outcome being assessed by the achievement standard. The achievement criteria and the explanatory notes contain information, definitions, and requirements that are crucial when interpreting the standard and assessing students/ākonga against it. 

**Context/Te Horopaki**

User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a digital system. The digital system could be a website, a web application or desktop software. 

The assessment activity requires students to:

- Explain the purpose of the outcome and the requirements of the end users and justify that the chosen design is suitable for the purpose and end users. 
- Generate a range of design ideas which make use of user experience methodologies and evaluate how the user experience methodologies were used to develop the chosen design.
- Develop an informed design for a digital outcome through effectively using data gained from modelling and user testing to improve the design.
- Justify how the chosen design might be further developed in the future.
- Explain the relevant implications and evaluate how the chosen design addresses relevant implications.
- Justify the choice of user experience methodologies used to develop the chosen design.

Note: This assessment task includes aspects of developing a refined design. You could integrate this material with another assessment where the student develops the outcome based on the design.

Teachers are encouraged to edit this task to make it suitable for their community.

**Conditions/Ngā Tikanga**

It is recommended that students should have multiple checkpoints with their teacher as they work through this assessment activity to ensure they have an opportunity to ask questions and gather feedback.

Conditions of Assessment related to this achievement standard can be found at <http://ncea.tki.org.nz/Resources-for-Internally-Assessed-Achievement-Standards>

**Resource requirements/Ngā Rauemi**

The list of resources for this standard will depend on the teaching and learning programme. As an overview, students will need access to appropriate software, cameras, internet etc. that can assist with collecting evidence of the application of user experience methodologies in the development of their chosen digital outcome.

**Introduction/Kupu Arataki**

This assessment activity requires you to apply user experience methodologies to develop a design for a digital outcome.

During the development of the design you need to provide evidence of applying user experience (UX) methodologies.

User experience is how a person perceives and responds when interfacing with a system. The system could be a website, a web application or desktop software.

Decide on how you will record evidence of the development of your design.  This could be in the form of an online presentation, blog, log, annotation of design concepts, screencast, or other forms of digital evidence.

You are going to be assessed on how well you develop, refine and justify the design for a digital outcome:

- Explain the purpose of the outcome and the requirements of the end users.
- Investigate relevant user experience methodologies. This could include usability evaluation techniques, user-interface design guidelines. Summarise your findings.
- Decide which user experience methodologies are best suited to the development of your chosen digital outcome. Give a justification for your choice.
- Use UX methodologies to generate a range of design ideas.
- Explain the appropriateness of the chosen design.
- Use modelling (for example, mock-ups) and user testing to test the design idea. You need to keep evidence of the feedback from user testing, and the data gained from your modelling. You could undertake further research to help refine/modify your designs. 
- Use the evidence from the modelling and user testing to justify why your design is suitable for the purpose and end users.
- Explain the relevant implications and evaluate how the chosen design addresses the relevant implications.
- Justify how the chosen design might be further developed in the future.

Teacher note: Insert due dates and timeframes

**Task/Hei Mahi**

Follow the steps below: 

**Design direction**

Explain the purpose of the design and the requirements of the end users.  You may need to conduct research around what the end users need the outcome to do or solve.  

Explain the relevant implications for your design 

**Investigate relevant user experience methodologies** and summarise your findings. These links might assist you:

Teacher note: Insert relevant links here for students.

**Generate a range of design ideas.**

**Choose a design and explain its appropriateness.**

**Model and test your chosen design**

This means you need to:

- test/check whether your ideas are feasible
- check that end users understand how your design will function
- test that your design addresses relevant implications (for example: usability, accessibility, functionality, internet information and intellectual property).

Your modelling and testing should be systematic and comprehensive. 

Effectively use data from modelling and user testing to further develop your chosen design.

Evaluate: 

- how user experience methodologies were used in developing the chosen design
- how the chosen design addresses relevant implications.

**Use data gained from testing and modelling to improve the design**

Present your design idea with annotations that show feedback on your design and improvements you made based on the feedback.  Evaluate the user experience and how you have applied user experience methodologies. 

**Justify how the chosen design makes use of user experience methodologies**

Justify:

- the choice of user experience methodologies used to develop the chosen design
- that the chosen design is suitable for the purpose and the end users 
- how your chosen design might be further developed in the future.

**Submit your evidence**

This will include:

1. Your design ideas
1. Evidence of how you developed your chosen design
1. The final design.
